This project is a part of the IBM Fullstack JavaScript Developer course. It represents the culmination of the skills learned throughout the course, including backend and frontend development, database management, and deployment to Kubernetes. The project focuses on building a full-stack web application that includes a Node.js backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database.

Features

	•	Backend: A RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, connected to a MongoDB database.
	•	Frontend: A React-based single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the backend API.
	•	Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
	•	Deployment: Dockerized application deployed to Kubernetes.
	•	Logging: Integrated logging using Pino for both backend and frontend services.
	•	Environment Configuration: Configured using .env files for both backend and frontend.
